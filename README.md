# FrenetFrame
Render space curves using Frenet-Serret Frame in DirectX D3D11. This is a Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 project in C++ targeting Windows 10 as a UWP application. This project depends on Chuck Walbourn's DirectXTK toolkit. DirectXTK for Windows 10 must be installed prior to building FrenetFrame. 

Wireframe toggle via F3 and F4 keyboard keys. 

See source code for additional space curves to render. Most of these space curves I derived from a paper by Herbert Edelsbrunner, "180 Wrapped Tubes".

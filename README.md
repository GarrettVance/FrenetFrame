# FrenetFrame
Render space curves using Frenet-Serret Frame in DirectX D3D11. This is a Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 project in C++ targeting Windows 10 as a UWP application. This project depends on Chuck Walbourn's DirectXTK toolkit. DirectXTK for Windows 10 must be installed prior to building FrenetFrame. 

Wireframe toggle via F3 and F4 keyboard keys.
